# LinearAlgebra
Linear Algebra using MATLAB

Project One

The goal of this project is to apply matrix theories to linear equations and transformations. This assignment analyzes a communication network for data rates, which are modeled mathematically as linear equations. The sum of inputs must equal the sum of outputs. All work is then submitted using MATLAB code to generate solutions in an easy-to-read PDF file.

Project Two

This assignment interprets the properties of vector spaces and utilizes advanced matrix techniques to solve complex linear problems. This assignmentâ€™s perspective is that of a computer programmer for a social media site that stores large amounts of media files. The task is to reduce costs by compressing image files using singular-value decomposition to help save the company money. A series of tests are performed and recorded to verify what level of decomposition can be done to the files without risking quality. The tests are then submitted using MATLAB code to generate an easy-to-read PDF file.
